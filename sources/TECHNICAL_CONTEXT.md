# Woodfire Companion — Technical Context Source

## Current implementation
Woodfire Companion is a zero-backend static PWA for GitHub Pages and installed iPhone/Safari use.

The application uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript with native ES modules. No runtime framework, backend, account system or external API is required.

Conceptual layers:
1. recipe/content data;
2. pure/testable planning engine;
3. session state + persistence/orchestration;
4. UI rendering/interactions.

Independent settings, shopping and journal stores remain separate when their lifecycles differ from the active cook.

## Application flow
Three top-level views:
1. `library` — illustrated recipes, qualification, active-cook resume, DEV test-cook and Cook Journal;
2. `recipe` — servings/service time, scaled shopping, serving-aware advance prep/equipment and planner-derived recommended start;
3. `cook` — active plan plus optional temperature tracking.

State is local-first and designed to remain usable offline once required assets are cached.

## Library and qualification
`recipes/index.json` is the discovery manifest and currently contains 11 `available` executable meals.

Availability and culinary maturity are separate:
- `status: available` means the generic app pipeline can execute the recipe;
- `qualification` is `untested`, `test_cooked` or `validated` and reflects real-cook evidence only.

Current baseline:
- Pork Belly — `validated`;
- turkey/gratin and barbacoa — `test_cooked`;
- eight 2026-08-31 expansion recipes — `untested` until representative real cooks are recorded.

See `sources/RECIPE_QUALIFICATION_V1.md`.

## Recipe/content and serving-aware instructions
Executable meals live under `recipes/*.json`. Recipe-specific timing/quantity rules must not be embedded in `app.js`.

`js/recipe.js` owns core validation, ingredient scaling and Woodfire summary formatting.

`js/step-details.js` owns structured `ingredientUsage` validation/materialization for two user-facing contexts:
- executable step summaries/details;
- `advancePrep[].details`.

Top-level ingredients remain authoritative for shopping totals. Local usage records are instructional metadata and do not independently aggregate shopping quantities.

`validateRecipeIngredientUsage()` validates both contexts before recipe use. `materializeRecipeForServings()` produces a detached serving-specific recipe view, while `materializeAdvancePrepForServings()` can be used directly by pre-cook rendering.

`js/recipe-loader.js` applies core recipe validation plus whole-recipe ingredient-usage validation.

This closes a previous inconsistency where the shopping list could scale while an advance marinade reminder remained hard-coded to reference servings.

## Current executable recipe set
The manifest exposes:
- Pork Belly Burnt Ends;
- roulé de dinde + gratin de courgettes;
- tacos barbacoa de bœuf fumée;
- saumon soja-miel + asperges + riz;
- poulet shawarma + pommes de terre + sauce yaourt;
- bœuf reverse-sear + grenailles + sauce poivre;
- wings miel-soja + potatoes + coleslaw;
- magret miel-soja-orange + patate douce;
- ribs BBQ + mac & cheese + coleslaw;
- halloumi + légumes + couscous;
- brochettes teriyaki + légumes + riz.

### Barbacoa V2
`recipes/smoked-beef-barbacoa.json` is content version 2.

V2 recovers serving-aware quantities that had been developed on an abandoned branch but never merged:
- advance marinade now materializes for 6–8 servings;
- salsa, braise, toppings and shell quantities are serving-aware in Active Cook;
- practical garlic step scaling avoids fractional cloves;
- the established 19:00 reference timeline, Woodfire sequence, tenderness criterion and planner buffers are unchanged.

See `sources/BARBACOA_TACOS_MEAL.md`.

## Generic multi-recipe acceptance
Every manifest entry with `status: available` is covered automatically; generic tests must not enumerate recipe ids.

At minimum CI verifies:
- manifest/recipe identity and qualification;
- core recipe + whole-recipe ingredient-usage validation;
- actionable top-level ingredient quantities;
- min/reference/max scaling and shopping generation;
- serving-aware advance prep with no unresolved `{{use:...}}` token;
- serving-materialized active schedule text with no unresolved token;
- dependency validity;
- Woodfire conflict freedom;
- unambiguous service milestone;
- local illustrated cover.

See `sources/MULTI_RECIPE_CONTRACT.md`.

## Serving configuration and pre-cook
`js/shopping.js` owns pure shopping/prep data logic. `getAdvancePrep(recipe, servings)` now materializes advance preparation for the selected servings using the same scaling semantics as active steps.

`js/prep-ui.js` passes the current serving selection into shopping and advance-prep rendering. Serving changes therefore update:
- shopping quantities;
- advance-prep quantities;
- active-cook quantities once the meal is scheduled.

Shopping state remains version-scoped under `woodfire-companion-shopping-v1` using `recipeId@recipeVersion`.

`recommendedStartFromPlan()` in `js/meal-planner.js` derives user-facing start guidance from the same generated plan used during cooking. `timing.elapsedRangeMin` remains descriptive metadata only.

Planner V1 does not synthesize batches or change duration automatically from servings; `servings.max` must stay within one credible execution structure.

## Planner V1
`js/planner.js` is the DOM-free low-level solver. `js/meal-planner.js` is the recipe-facing facade.

Planning inputs include:
- servings;
- `mealTime` or absolute `targetServingAt`;
- dependencies/lags;
- durations/ranges;
- planning buffers;
- resource reservations;
- explicit task delays;
- actual starts/completions;
- expected completion from pending rechecks.

Baseline planning works backwards from service. The Woodfire is currently the only automatically conflict-resolved exclusive resource. Other declared resources may run concurrently but are not generally conflict-solved.

Started/completed timestamps are historical facts and are never moved merely to make a plan tidy.

The solver supports dependency-only recipes without preferred offsets, midnight crossing, buffer absorption, runtime propagation and service slippage when reality can no longer meet the target.

## Active-cook orchestration
`js/active-cook-controller.js` owns DOM-free runtime orchestration:
- schedule recomputation;
- step start/finish/reset;
- observation/recheck application;
- +5/+10/+15 next-action delays;
- planning reset;
- served-cook journal synchronization.

Runtime step states are `upcoming`, `active`, `done`. Pending rechecks remain actionable next steps and feed expected completion back into planning.

`app.js` remains top-level rendering/navigation wiring rather than the owner of these mutations.

## Session state V3
Active cook state remains under compatibility key `woodfire-companion-v1` with explicit schema migration.

`js/session.js` owns lifecycle, migration, timestamp correction and detached recipe snapshots. A new cook snapshots validated recipe content so a later deployment cannot silently alter an in-progress cook.

DEV test sessions use the same planner/session path, can temporarily back up a real session and never enter the real Cook Journal.

## Observations / rechecks
`js/observations.js` owns pure observation logic.

Not-ready observations keep the step incomplete and create a future recheck. Ready observations record actual completion. Pending recheck time is passed into planning so buffers may absorb limited delay before dependent work/service moves.

## Temperature tracking
Temperature tracking is optional per recipe.

`js/temperature.js` owns pure validation/data semantics; `js/temperature-ui.js` owns fast entry, target editing, samples, chart, undo/new-series and CSV export.

Manual logging remains value → Add/Enter → automatic timestamp. Measurements do not automatically complete recipe steps. No ETA is inferred from temperature slope.

## Cook Journal V2
Cook history remains separate under `woodfire-companion-journal-v1`.

Journal entries retain recipe/version, servings, target/actual service, schedule, actual starts/completions, observations, delays, temperatures, rating and notes. Versioned local JSON backup/import validates before writing and merges by stable session id.

Raw real-cook feedback should be captured in the journal first; durable findings are promoted into recipe/source revisions and may justify qualification changes.

## PWA/offline
The service worker uses network-first fetch with offline fallback and a separate cache generation.

Current dev application version remains `0.3.0-dev.10`. This change rotates `CACHE_REVISION` so installed clients can preload the recovered serving-aware modules/content through the normal conservative service-worker lifecycle.

No `skipWaiting()` is used: a new generation must not replace the worker controlling an already-open long cook. It activates after existing controlled clients close.

Available recipe JSON and covers are discovered from `recipes/index.json`; individual recipe files are not hard-coded in the static shell list.

## Testing and CI
Run:

```bash
npm test
```

GitHub Actions covers generic recipe acceptance, qualification, serving/prep materialization, planner behavior, observations, session migration/snapshots, timestamp correction, journal backup, optional temperature tracking, PWA/offline lifecycle and static UI/module contracts.

## Current technical priorities
1. Keep source contracts synchronized with merged behavior.
2. Qualify representative current recipes through installed-iPhone real cooks before expanding recipe count by default.
3. Use real cooks to decide whether flexible windows, non-Woodfire conflicts, batching or external components are needed.
4. Continue small `app.js` extractions only where ownership becomes materially unclear.
5. Complete safe branch cleanup and protect `main` with CI if repository settings allow it.
6. Periodically validate PWA update/offline behavior on installed iPhone.
7. Add predictive ETA only later from clean history with explicit uncertainty.
