# Woodfire Companion — Tacos Barbacoa Meal

## Status
Executable curated meal for Woodfire Companion. Recipe file: `recipes/smoked-beef-barbacoa.json`, current content version **2**.

This meal promotes the previous family barbacoa plan into the shared Recipe Schema V1 / Planner V1 pipeline rather than adding recipe-specific UI or planner logic.

## Reference meal
- 8 people.
- 2.6 kg boneless beef shank, ideally kept as two pieces for the declared execution structure.
- Hard taco shells for service.
- Smoked salsa plus a compact fresh-toppings buffet.
- No alcohol/flambé.
- Reference service time: 19:00.

The executable serving range is intentionally limited to 6–8 people so the declared two-piece / single-Woodfire execution structure remains credible without batch synthesis.

## Barbacoa flavor base
Reference marinade for 8:
- juice of 2 oranges;
- juice of 2 limes;
- 6 garlic cloves;
- 2 tbsp tomato paste;
- 2 tbsp cider vinegar;
- 1.5–2 tsp chipotle powder;
- 2 tsp ground cumin;
- 2 tsp dried oregano;
- 1 tbsp smoked paprika;
- 25–30 g salt;
- about 1 tsp black pepper.

Marinate ideally overnight, or at least 2 h before cooking.

Covered braise additions at the 8-person reference:
- 2 sliced yellow onions;
- all reserved marinade;
- 400–500 mL hot beef stock;
- 2 bay leaves.

## V2 serving-aware preparation and cook quantities
Content V2 removes reference-8 quantities that previously remained hard-coded when the meal was configured for 6 people.

The same structured `ingredientUsage` mechanism now applies to `advancePrep` as well as Active Cook steps. The pre-cook marinade reminder therefore follows the serving selector before the cooking session starts.

### Marinade examples
For 6 people:
- 1.95 kg boneless beef shank;
- 2 oranges;
- 1.5 limes, leaving the remaining lime allocation for salsa/service;
- 5 garlic cloves;
- 1.5 tbsp tomato paste;
- 1.5 tbsp cider vinegar;
- scaled chipotle/cumin/oregano/paprika;
- 18.75–22.5 g salt;
- 0.75 tsp black pepper.

For 8 people the original reference remains 2.6 kg beef, 2 oranges, 2 limes, 6 garlic cloves, 2 tbsp tomato paste/vinegar, the original spice amounts and 25–30 g marinade salt.

Garlic shopping quantity now uses a practical step rule: 5 cloves for 6 people and 6 for 7–8, rather than presenting a fractional clove count.

### Salsa, braise and taco bar
At 6 people the generated instructions now use, among other values:
- 450 g tomatoes and 1 jalapeño for the smoked salsa;
- approximately 11.25 g coriander + 3 g salt when blending salsa;
- 1.5 yellow onions + 300–375 mL beef stock in the braise;
- 225 g cheddar, 187.5 g lettuce, 2 avocados, approximately 11.25 g coriander and 300 g sour cream for the taco bar;
- 18 hard taco shells.

At 8 people the original 600 g tomatoes, 400–500 mL stock, 300 g cheddar, 250 g lettuce, 3 avocados, 400 g sour cream and 24 shells remain unchanged.

V2 changes quantities/instruction consistency only. It does not change the reference execution timing, Woodfire configuration, tenderness completion criterion or planner buffers.

## Woodfire sequence
### Smoked salsa vegetables
- mode: GRILL;
- setpoint: 200 °C (190–210 °C acceptable declared range);
- smoke: ON;
- pellets: yes;
- support: grill surface;
- uncovered;
- tomatoes, white onion and jalapeño directly on the grill;
- planned duration: 20 min.

This uses otherwise passive beef-tempering time and releases the Woodfire before the beef-smoking phase.

### Beef smoke
- mode: SMOKER;
- setpoint: 125 °C (125–130 °C declared range);
- smoke: ON;
- pellets: yes;
- support: grill surface;
- uncovered;
- two pieces directly on the grill;
- planned duration: 90 min.

Surface appearance, not internal temperature, ends this phase.

### Covered braise
- mode: BAKE/ROAST;
- setpoint: 140 °C (135–140 °C declared range);
- smoke: OFF;
- pellets: no;
- support: large deep Woodfire-compatible roasting dish;
- covered tightly with foil;
- planned duration: 420 min, declared range 300–420 min.

The 420 min planning value intentionally represents the conservative long-cook reference. Real completion is tenderness-driven.

## Completion logic
The first true doneness check is planned around 17:00 for a 19:00 service.

~93 °C core temperature is only a useful reference. The authoritative completion state is probe/fork tenderness across both pieces. If still firm, reseal and continue at 140 °C in 20–30 min increments.

After the meat is ready:
- rest beef 45 min;
- reduce braising juices on the stovetop for about 20 min in parallel;
- shred for about 20 min;
- add enough reduced juice back to keep the barbacoa very moist.

The plan keeps about 55 min of baseline margin between finished shredding and service. Rechecks may consume that margin before service time moves.

## Salsa and taco bar
Smoked salsa reference for 8:
- 600 g tomatoes;
- 1 white onion;
- 2 jalapeños at the 8-person reference;
- juice of 1 lime;
- about 15 g coriander;
- about 4 g salt.

Taco bar reference for 8:
- 24 hard taco shells (~3/person);
- 300 g grated cheddar;
- 250 g shredded lettuce;
- 3 avocados;
- 1 red onion, very thinly sliced;
- about 15 g coriander;
- 400 g sour cream / thick crème fraîche;
- lime wedges;
- smoked salsa;
- barbacoa and reduced juices served separately from the shells.

## Reference timeline — service 19:00
- 07:45 — take beef out of refrigerator;
- 08:10 — smoke/grill salsa vegetables;
- 08:30 — start beef smoke; blend salsa in parallel;
- 10:00 — transfer beef to covered braise at 140 °C;
- 17:00 — first tenderness check; if ready, rest beef and reduce juices in parallel;
- 17:45 — shred beef and return reduced juices;
- 18:00 — prepare fresh taco toppings;
- 18:45 — warm hard taco shells;
- 19:00 — serve.

## Planner/schema semantics exercised
This third real meal exercises existing V1 planning concepts and now provides the real use case for serving-aware advance-prep materialization:
- multiple meal components;
- serving-aware advance-prep reminders;
- serving-aware Active Cook quantities;
- shared exclusive Woodfire resource across salsa, smoke and braise;
- passive tempering concurrent with Woodfire work;
- stovetop reduction concurrent with passive meat rest;
- tenderness observation + recheck;
- temperature logging as supporting information;
- baseline service buffer that can absorb a limited long-cook delay;
- final oven task independent of the Woodfire.

No new resource model, batching model or planning-window abstraction is required for this recipe.
