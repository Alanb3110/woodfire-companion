# Woodfire Companion — Cook Journal V1 Source

## Scope
Cook Journal V1 stores completed meal sessions locally and exposes them from the recipe library. It is local-first/offline and does not introduce accounts, cloud storage or a backend.

A journal entry is created automatically when the recipe's real service milestone is completed.

## Storage
Journal data uses a dedicated versioned namespace:

`woodfire-companion-journal-v1`

Stored shape:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 1,
  "entries": []
}
```

The active-cook state remains in its separate session store; shopping and UI preferences keep independent keys.

Clearing the journal must not clear the active cook, shopping checks or UI preferences.

## Session identity
Every new cook gets:
- stable `sessionId`;
- `sessionStartedAt`;
- absolute `targetServingAt`;
- optional `sessionServedAt` once service is completed.

Older active sessions remain readable through the active-session migration layer.

## Archive trigger
The recipe's resolved service step is the completion trigger.

When it is completed:
1. actual completion is recorded as usual;
2. Planner V1 recalculates the final feasible schedule;
3. the current session is upserted into the journal under `sessionId`.

The operation is idempotent. If service completion is removed while editing the same session, the corresponding journal entry is removed until the meal is marked served again.

## Entry snapshot
A V1 entry stores:
- journal schema version;
- session id;
- recipe id/version/title;
- servings;
- target meal time + absolute target serving timestamp;
- session start and actual served timestamp;
- temperature target;
- all manual temperature samples;
- structured observations;
- actual step start timestamps when available;
- actual completed-step timestamps;
- explicit step delays;
- total recipe step count;
- schedule snapshot for every step.

`started` is an additive field. Older Journal V1 entries without it remain valid.

Each schedule record retains:
- step id/title/component;
- baseline start/end;
- final replanned start/end.

This preserves enough history for later comparison of planned vs actual phase timing without depending on the current repository recipe remaining unchanged.

## Library UI
The library shows a `Cuissons passées` section below recipe cards.

Each journal card is collapsed by default and shows service date, recipe title, actual service time, target service time and service delta when available.

Expanded history shows servings, completed/total steps, temperature sample count, planned/replanned timings, actual completions and recent temperature measurements. The raw journal retains all samples.

## Active vs completed cook
Once a session has been served, it should no longer appear as `CUISSON EN COURS` in the library.

Starting a new cook creates a new `sessionId`; the prior served entry stays in the journal.

## Clear behavior
The library exposes an explicit journal-clear action with confirmation.

## Limitations / future work
Journal V1 does not yet provide:
- notes or rating after a cook;
- photos;
- per-cook ingredient substitutions;
- journal search/filter;
- JSON export/import/backup;
- cross-device sync;
- statistical comparison across repeated cooks;
- automatic ETA learning.

The stored structure is intentionally rich enough to support later comparison/learning while keeping the current UI simple.
